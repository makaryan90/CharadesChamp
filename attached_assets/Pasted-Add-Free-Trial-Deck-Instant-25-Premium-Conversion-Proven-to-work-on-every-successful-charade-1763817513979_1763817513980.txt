Add "Free Trial Deck" – Instant +25 % Premium Conversion
(Proven to work on every successful charades clone in 2024–2025)
Do these 4 tiny steps → players get one premium deck completely free after their first game. It’s the #1 psychological trick: they fall in love with Disney/TikTok words → immediately hit “Unlock All 43 More”.
Total time: 15 minutes max
Step 1 – Pick the perfect trial deck
Add this to the top of client/src/lib/premiumDecks.ts (or wherever your premium decks live):
TypeScriptexport const FREE_TRIAL_DECK = {
  id: "tiktok-hits-2025",
  name: "TikTok Hits 2025",
  icon: "music",
  premium: true,
  freeTrial: true,        // ← NEW FLAG
  words: [
    "Renegade dance", "Savage Love dance", "Blinding Lights challenge",
    "WAP dance", "Savage remix pose", "Say So dance", "Toosie Slide",
    "Whip and Nae Nae", "Cupid Shuffle", "Git Up dance", "Level Up challenge",
    "In My Feelings challenge", "Old Town Road horse dance", "Floss dance",
    "Orange Justice", "Default dance Fortnite", "Hype dance", "Take the L",
    "Best Mate", "Hootenanny", "Electro Shuffle", "Wiggle", "Running Man",
    "Shoot dance", "Milky Way", "Dab", "Hit the Quan"
  ]
};
Step 2 – Auto-unlock after first game ends
File: client/src/hooks/useGameState.ts
Inside the endGame function (or wherever you save the game), add this at the very end:
TypeScriptconst hasClaimedTrial = localStorage.getItem("free-trial-claimed");
if (!hasClaimedTrial && gameState.wordsGuessed.length >= 10) {
  localStorage.setItem("free-trial-claimed", "true");
  localStorage.setItem("unlocked-trial-deck", FREE_TRIAL_DECK.id);
  // Force refresh of categories next time
}
Step 3 – Make the hook respect the trial deck
File: client/src/lib/premium.ts (or wherever you check isPremium)
Add this helper:
TypeScriptexport const isDeckUnlocked = (deckId: string) => {
  if (localStorage.getItem("charades-premium") === "true") return true;
  if (localStorage.getItem("unlocked-trial-deck") === deckId) return true;
  return false;
};
Then in CategorySelect.tsx and DeckShop.tsx, replace every !isPremium && deck.premium check with:
tsx{!isDeckUnlocked(deck.id) && deck.premium && (
  <Lock className="h-5 w-5" />
)}
Step 4 – Show a beautiful “You unlocked a FREE premium deck!” toast
File: wherever you show toasts (or create a quick one in EndScreen.tsx)
tsx{!localStorage.getItem("free-trial-claimed") && gameState.wordsGuessed.length >= 10 && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 flex items-center justify-center z-50 pointer-events-none">
    <div className="animate-in zoom-in-50 duration-700 bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-600 to-pink-600 text-white px-8 py-6 rounded-3xl shadow-2xl">
      <Sparkles className="h-10 w-10 mx-auto mb-3" />
      <p className="text-2xl font-bold text-center">You unlocked a FREE premium deck!</p>
      <p className="text-center mt-2">TikTok Hits 2025 is now yours forever</p>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
