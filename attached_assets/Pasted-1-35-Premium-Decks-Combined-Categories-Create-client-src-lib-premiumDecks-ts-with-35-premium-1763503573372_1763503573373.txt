1. 35 Premium Decks + Combined Categories
   - Create client/src/lib/premiumDecks.ts with 35 premium packs (25–30 words each):  
     Disney, Marvel Heroes, Harry Potter, Friends Quotes, The Office, TikTok Dances, Adult 18+, Christmas Songs, Halloween, 80s Movies, 90s Hits, Netflix Shows, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Reality TV Stars, etc.
   - Update client/src/lib/categories.ts → add premium: true to each premium deck
   - Export const allCategories = [...originalFreeCategories, ...premiumDecks]

2. Premium Hook
   - Create client/src/lib/premium.ts → usePremium() hook with isPremium, unlockPremium(), and a "restore purchase" button

3. Deck Shop Screen (this alone drives 70% of revenue)
   - Create client/src/components/game/DeckShop.tsx
   - Beautiful grid of ALL 44 categories (9 free + 35 premium)
   - Show lock + "Premium" badge on locked ones
   - Add "New" and "Popular" tags
   - Click locked → open Paywall

4. Gorgeous Paywall Modal
   - Replace current fake modal with client/src/components/game/PaywallModal.tsx
   - Three options: Lifetime $9.99 · Yearly $19.99 (Best Value) · Monthly $2.99
   - "Unlock Now" simulates purchase (sets localStorage + confetti + thank you message)
   - Add comment // TODO: RevenueCat integration here

5. Hybrid Monetization (Web-Friendly Version)
   - npm install @capacitor-community/admob && npm install canvas-confetti
   - Create client/src/lib/ads.ts with:
     • Mock rewarded ad → gives +10 seconds when time < 15s
     • Mock interstitial on EndScreen → MainMenu (skipped if premium)
   - Add "Watch Ad for +10 Sec" button in GamePlay when timer < 15s
   - Add "Remove Ads Forever" in Paywall

6. Viral Polish That Works Everywhere
   - On correct guess: canvas-confetti explosion + strong haptic navigator.vibrate([200, 100, 200])
   - Add "Go Premium" banner on MainMenu if not premium
   - Add "More Decks →" button in MainMenu and CategorySelect

7. Final Integration
   - Update CategorySelect.tsx to use allCategories and show padlocks
   - Update game logic to pull from allCategories (respect premium lock)
   - When user tries to select locked category → auto-open PaywallModal
